# PR Review Loop

`execute shepherd-pr [PR_URL]` owns a draft pull request from its first Cursor review trigger through approval or two thermo-nuclear review rounds, whichever comes first. Ticket delivery enters this workflow automatically after publishing a draft PR.

## Standing authorization

The user has authorized this workflow to:

- post `/check` comments;
- wait for and inspect Cursor reviews;
- make, verify, commit and push minimal in-scope fixes;
- reply with evidence when feedback is invalid or already addressed;
- repeat those actions for at most two completed thermo-nuclear review rounds; and
- mark the draft ready for review after the approval gate passes.

Do not ask for confirmation for those actions. This authorization does not permit merging, force-pushing, changing the PR base, resolving unrelated feedback, broadening ticket scope, or ignoring repository publication rules.

## Establish the review cycle

1. Resolve the PR from the URL or current branch. Confirm it is open and that the assigned worktree matches its head branch. Preserve unrelated user changes.
2. Confirm the repository supports the `/check` trigger and identify the repository's two Cursor review actions from actual check and review metadata.
3. Confirm the current commit is pushed, then post a PR comment containing exactly `/check`. Verify the comment exists. Record the head SHA and comment timestamp for this cycle so stale reviews cannot satisfy the gate.
4. Start a thermo-nuclear round counter at zero. Increment it only when the thermo-nuclear action
   triggered by this invocation's latest `/check` produces a completed review.

## Wait and inspect

Poll the host API at a reasonable interval until both Cursor actions triggered for the recorded head have completed. Do not busy-wait. Keep running in the assigned session so the user can work elsewhere.

A successful check run proves only that the automation executed. Approval must come from each action's review state or explicit review conclusion. Fetch full formal reviews, review bodies, inline comments, general comments, thread state and check details using the **Collect feedback** rules in `skill://execute/reference/update-pr.md`.

Before acting, verify the PR head is still the recorded SHA. If another authorized actor pushed, restart the cycle against the new head without overwriting their work.

## Triage and respond
Before changing code, read `skill://ponytail` if that skill is installed and apply its full ladder.
Reviewer feedback identifies a concern, not the implementation: use the least-complex fix that
preserves correctness, prefer deletion/reuse over new abstraction, and push back on requested
complexity when a simpler fix works.

Classify every new substantive finding against the current code:

- **Valid:** make the smallest root-cause fix, add or update only a valuable behavioral check, run targeted verification, commit and push without force.
- **Invalid or already addressed:** reply at the finding with concise code or test evidence. Do not change code merely to appease a mistaken review.
- **Ambiguous or conflicting:** investigate repository and ticket evidence first. Notify the user only when a product decision or unavailable prerequisite truly prevents an informed choice.

Before pushing a review fix or replying that it is addressed, apply the acceptance gate in
`skill://execute`: manually recheck the criteria and connected behavior affected by the revision.
Before marking ready, reconcile every criterion against the current head; previous-head checks and
Cursor approval do not substitute for the manual pass. If any applicable criterion fails or cannot
be exercised, keep the PR draft and report the blocker rather than treating the review gate as passed.

Reply to every substantive finding with its disposition. Never claim verification that was not run.
After all fixes and replies are published, confirm the new head is remote, refresh the PR's testing
section, and immediately send the revision testing handoff from `skill://execute` before waiting for
another review. If fewer than two thermo-nuclear rounds have completed, comment exactly `/check`
again, record the new head and trigger timestamp, then return to **Wait and inspect**. After the
second completed thermo-nuclear round, do not post another `/check`.

If an action fails without producing a substantive review, inspect the failure. Fix an in-scope cause; otherwise retrigger once. Repeated infrastructure failure, missing authentication, an unavailable reviewer action, or the same unsupported finding recurring without new evidence is a blocker: preserve the draft and notify the user with links and the exact reason.
Two thermo-nuclear rounds are a hard cap even when the risk analysis has not approved or the second
round caused another code change. If the approval gate does not hold after processing round two,
leave the PR as a draft and hand it to the user with the PR URL, both review results, unresolved
findings, fixes and pushbacks already made, current head, and verification performed.

## Approval gate

Continue the cycle until all of these are true for the current head and latest `/check` cycle:

- the risk analysis action explicitly approves;
- the thermo-nuclear review explicitly approves or states that no blocking changes are required;
- no newer unresolved `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review or substantive Cursor finding remains; and
- required repository checks are not failing because of this PR.

Approval from one Cursor action never substitutes for the other. An old approval, green automation run, author's reply, dismissed review, or outdated thread does not satisfy this gate.

## Finish

Re-read the PR head, draft state, approvals and checks immediately before transition. If the gate still holds, mark the PR ready for review using the host's supported command and verify the draft flag changed. Do not merge it.

Notify the user with the PR URL, the approval evidence from both Cursor actions, fixes or pushbacks made during the loop, verification performed, and confirmation that the PR is ready for review.
Include the current testing URL and actionable steps from `skill://execute`'s **Testing handoffs**
contract, updated for the final head, so the ready-for-review notification is also usable for testing.
