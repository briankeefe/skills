# Execute Ticket

`execute <ticket ID, URL, or name>` requests implementation. Use discovery and authorization rules in `skill://execute`.

## Establish context and plan

1. Read the ticket description, acceptance criteria, relevant comments, attachments and dependencies through the configured provider. Locate the affected behavior and existing repository patterns.
2. Resolve missing requirements from available evidence. Ask only if the intended outcome, scope or required dependency remains unclear; do not invent acceptance criteria or silently narrow the request.
3. Confirm the assigned repository/worktree and intended PR base. Reuse the current environment and repository install/verification commands.
4. Make a proportionate plan covering affected files, every acceptance criterion, risks and verification. **Proceed without another plan-approval round when implementation is authorized.** Pause only for real ambiguity, material scope/risk decisions or sensitive actions outside the existing authorization.
5. If materially different solutions satisfy the wording but not the same user outcome, resolve that distinction before building the larger one.

## Implement, verify and review

- Follow the red/green TDD contract in `skill://execute`: capture the failing behavior before
  production edits, make the minimum fix, then prove the same check passes.
- Make the smallest complete change following existing patterns; fix the root cause and migrate affected callers.
- For bugs, confirm the reported reproduction no longer fails after green. Keep a useful regression
  test when practical; otherwise remove the throwaway check and report the smoke check and its
  limitations. Do not repeat a user-reported failure manually merely to confirm it.
- Before publishing the draft, manually exercise **every feasible acceptance criterion** on the
  actual changed surface, not just one representative journey or a demo recording. For stateful
  criteria, check the same record through edit, visible result, save, reload, and reopen or cancel
  where applicable. Include named negative and scope cases, plus the boundary implied by the change
  (for example, multiple selections or a missing step). Tests and builds do not substitute for this.
  If the required runtime is unavailable or a criterion fails, fix the failure or report the blocker;
  do not publish the draft while any criterion is failing or unverified.
- Record each criterion's observed result and environment (real API/database, local UI, staging,
  or unverified), run applicable repository CI checks after edits settle, and report exact commands
  and gaps. Do not label a criterion staged when only a bundle or deploy was observed.
- Review correctness and scope against the request; fix blocking findings and repeat affected verification. Keep an environment needed for the user's visual review.

## Feature demo video (when requested)

Use the existing `playwright-demo-kit` checkout and read its `README.md` before recording. Confirm the frontend **and backend** target are safe for demo actions; do not hardcode credentials or record secrets. From the kit root, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` and any existing demo auth variables as needed, then select the one feature spec and run test plus render under **one** lock:

```bash
DEMO_SLUG=<ticket-or-work-slug> python3 scripts/with-recording-lock.py -- sh -c 'npx playwright test -c playwright.demo.config.ts tests/demo/<feature>.demo.spec.ts && npm run demo:render'
```

Replace both placeholders with the actual work identifier and spec path. `DEMO_SLUG=<slug> npm run demo:flow` is only for deliberately recording **all** kit specs; its render selects the newest video. Do not start capture via bare `npx playwright test`, run separate test/render steps for a feature showcase, delete the lock file, or bypass a busy lock. The macOS file lock spans the recorder child and releases when it exits; the JSON slug/time is informational, not a stale timeout. This protects recordings on this Mac only. Report the actual video path and observed result, not just a test listing.

## Deliver

Update existing documentation when the contract requires it. Follow the publication authorization in `skill://execute`; an existing instruction to commit/push/publish needs no repeat confirmation.

Include the ticket link, concise result, verification, relevant UI evidence and limitations in the
draft PR, including the testing checklist from `skill://execute`'s **Testing handoffs** contract.
After publishing the draft, immediately send that testing handoff to the user, then run
`skill://execute/reference/review-loop.md`; do not return merely because the PR exists or wait for
reviews before providing the testing link and steps. Notify the user when the review gate completes
or reaches a blocker it cannot resolve. Missing optional reviewers do not block authorized publication.
